Action chunking as conditional policy compression

::: {#abstracts}
::: {#d1e1180}
Highlights
----------

::: {#d1e1183}
-   •

    Action chunking emerges as a trade-off between reward and cognitive
    effort.

-   •

    People use temporal structure to reduce policy complexity and
    respond faster.

-   •

    Higher working memory load leads to more chunking to conserve
    cognitive resources.

-   •

    Chunking frees up memory for other, unchunked information.

Abstract
--------

::: {#d1e1174}
Many skills in our everyday lives are learned by sequencing actions
towards a desired goal. The action sequence can become a "chunk" when
individual actions are grouped together and executed as one unit, making
them more efficient to store and execute. While chunking has been
studied extensively across various domains, a puzzle remains as to why
and under what conditions action chunking occurs. To tackle these
questions, we develop a model of *conditional* policy compression---the
reduction in cognitive cost by conditioning on an additional source of
information---to explain the origin of chunking. We argue that chunking
is a result of optimizing the trade-off between reward and conditional
policy complexity. Chunking compresses policies when there is temporal
structure in the environment that can be leveraged for action selection,
reducing the amount of memory necessary to encode the policy. We
experimentally confirm our model's predictions, showing that chunking
reduces conditional policy complexity and reaction times. Chunking also
increases with working memory load, consistent with the hypothesis that
the degree of policy compression scales with the scarcity of cognitive
resources. Finally, chunking also reduces overall working memory load,
freeing cognitive resources for the benefit of other, not-chunked
information.
